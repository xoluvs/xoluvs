## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have just started working working on my public profile and portfolio. Pardon my dust while I clean the place up. 

About Me:

I am an experienced Senior Instructional Designer / Program Manager / Trainer.  With over 25 years of experience in customer service and over ten years in instructional design and training, I offer a unique blend of technical expertise and educational leadership that aligns perfectly with your requirements. I specialize in developing impactful and engaging training experiences that deliver measurable results. Through innovative instructional design, I consistently create an  interactive learning experience that resonate with learners while continuously expanding my expertise. My career spans both front-end support and back-end training development across multiple technical, customer service, and healthcare sectors. I enjoy creating simulations that enrich learners retention and include gamification elements to keep it entertaining. I continuly work to stretch my skills with volunteer work in my community. My commitment to community service provides opportunities for professional growth while allowing me to make meaningful contributions to those around me. 

I'm currently looking for a remote position that allows me to continue my personal growth and development. I enjoy compiling data to look at the results after completing a project with my partner teams. I am most excited by new projects and learning opertunities. I am working on getting back to college to finish my degrees in Computer Science. I find that using coding in combination with programs such as Articulate Storyline enhance your options with gamification elements, reporting, and learner engagement.
