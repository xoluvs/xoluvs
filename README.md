I have just started working working on my public profile and portfolio. Pardon my dust while I clean the place up. 

About Me:

I am an experienced Senior Instructional Designer / Program Manager / Trainer. With over 25 years of experience in customer service and over ten years in instructional design and training, I offer a unique blend of technical expertise and educational leadership that aligns well with many carrers. I specialize in developing impactful, global and engaging training experiences that delivers measurable results. In my trainings, I use interactive designs that engage learners with fun activities that resonate with learners long after their training ends. My career spans both front-end support and back-end training development across multiple technical, customer service, and healthcare sectors. I enjoy creating technical trainings and simulations that bring gamification, DEI, and adult learning elements together in a harmonious mix. I use my volunteer work to stretch my skills with volunteer work in my community. My commitment to community service provides opportunities for professional growth while allowing me to make meaningful contributions to those around me. 

I'm currently looking for a remote position that allows me to continue my personal growth and development. I enjoy compiling data to look at the results after completing a project with my partner teams. I am most excited by new projects and learning opertunities. I am working on getting back to college to finish my degrees in Computer Science. I find that using coding in combination with programs such as Articulate Storyline enhance your options with gamification elements, reporting, and learner engagement.
